  # one target removed that link and with it the inheritance - the first build
  # after the move failed on mod-dungeon-clear (not on a bot source) with
  # "Config.h: No such file or directory". Recovered verbatim from the removed
  # root-CMakeLists block; duplicates with the common list are harmless.
