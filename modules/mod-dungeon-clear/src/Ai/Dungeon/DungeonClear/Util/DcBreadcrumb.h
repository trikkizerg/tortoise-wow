// Drop a breadcrumb of the tank's current position onto the trail followers
// walk up (DungeonClearFollowTankAction's centered trail-follow) and the
// advanced pull walks back to place its camp. Called each forward-advance /
// objective-drive tick; samples only every kSpacing yards of real movement, and
// RESTARTS the trail on a kJump-sized gap (a pull drag-back or a teleport) so
// the stored trail is always spatially contiguous behind the tank —
// independent of the long-path follower cursor, which the drag resets.
//
// Hoisted here (was file-local to DcAdvanceAction.cpp) so the barrel / item-on-GO
// objective drive can record crumbs too: without them followers had no centered
// trail to inherit on the long Old Hillsbrad courtyard->prison-yard leg and fell
// back to wall-hugging Follow().
